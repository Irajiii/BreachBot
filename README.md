## BreachBot
This project is created to inform users about the Meta data breach and how many years have passed since the breach. 
This project is created for GirlsWhoCode Summer Self-Paced Program 2023

## Purpose
The chatbot first asks the user about the year they are currently in. 
Using the year, the chatbot replies with how many years have passed since the breach occurred.
User is then prompted whether they would like to know more about the breach. If yes, the chatbot provides information about the breach and about different topics; if not, the chat ends.
